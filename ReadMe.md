# Level Up

Here, I am fashioning a simple node project so that I can import the code for the book 'Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming' into a node project and run the code in the book.

To play with the code using this project, simply run `node` in a terminal to open the node REPL, and then type `.load index.js` to load the code from the book into the REPL.  Then you can play with the code from the book in the REPL.
